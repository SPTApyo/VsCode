This repository contains all my personal programs, from the first to the last, through which I learned computing and programming.
Honestly, it's the first time I've used VsCode and github and it's very confusing and poorly done for beginners, like the pain of just renaming certain files where the option isn't even available for some reason.
(and I'm French, so don't be surprised to find parts of the program in French.)
